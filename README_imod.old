###############################################


In this release (v1.04), the last stable versions of iMOD tools are provided.
They are intended to work, but testing is very limited. 


--------
OVERVIEW
--------

With the iMOD tools you will be able to compute, visualize, and animate the
normal modes of both proteins and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), as well as, 
to perform Monte-Carlo simulations, analyze deformability, and compute feasible
trajectories between two different conformations using such modes. 

The internal coordinates formulation of iMOD implicitly preserves the covalent
structure and effectively extends the applicability range to larger systems and
conformational changes.


--------
PROVIDED
--------

We provide statically linked executables generated with Intel and GNU 
compilers to minimize library dependence problems. Dynamic linking was used
for the Intel releases that employ diagonalization routines.

> Programs provided
-------------------
imode    v1.20 --> Tool for NMA in Internal Coordinate Space (ICS).
imove    v1.14 --> Movie maker based on ICS Normal Modes.
imodview v1.08 --> Normal modes visualization tool.
imc      v1.11 --> Monte-Carlo tool based on ICS normal modes.
imorph   v1.44 --> Morphing tool based on ICS normal modes.

*All the programs show a basic help text using the --help option.

> Binaries releases
-------------------

Pre-compiled binaries are available in the corresponding bin/ directory. You 
can choose the appropriate release for your system:

 [Program]        Compiler    Libraries              Linkage
 -----------------------------------------------------------
*<TOOL>           Intel icpc  -                      static
*<TOOL>_mkl       Intel icpc  Intel MKL              dynamic
 <TOOL>_gcc       GNU gcc     BLAS/LAPACK            static

* Intel compiled binaries are the fastest alternatives. 
<TOOL> corresponds to the name of the program.


------------
REQUIREMENTS
------------

Statically linked executables are ready-to-use (nothing else required).

The following libraries and compilers may be required only to run the
pre-compiled binaries that employ diagonalization routines (imode and imorph):


> For Intel release: 
--------------------

- Intel's C++ and Fortran Compilers - Current tested version of icpc and ifort
is 13.0.1 (gcc version 4.6.0 compatibility).

- Intel's MKL libraries: BLAS and LAPACK implementations optimized for Intel
processors (Current tested version Intel MKL 11.0 update 1).

These Intel libraries and compiler can be obtained for free from Intel's 
web site:
http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/non-commercial-software-download/

Please, download and install the Intel Compilers and Math Kernel Library:
  "Intel C++ Composer XE for Linux" (current tested version is 2013.1.117)


> For GNU release: 
------------------

- All GNU pre-compiled binaries were compiled and statically linked using the
GNU gcc compiler version 4.6.3. They should run directly on any modern Linux
kernel without any dependence requirement.


* In case you don't conform any of these requirements, you can use the 
static binaries to avoid any dependence related problem.
